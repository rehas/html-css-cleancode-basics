  <h1>HTML: Structure</h1>

  <p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt; p &gt; element.</p>

  <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:

    &lt; !DOCTYPE html &gt;
    &lthtml&gt

    &lthead&gt
      &ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt
      &lttitle&gtMy test page&lt/title&gt
    &lt/head&gt

    &ltbody&gt
      &ltp&gtThis is my page&lt/p&gt
    &lt/body&gt

    &lt/html&gt
    Here we have:
