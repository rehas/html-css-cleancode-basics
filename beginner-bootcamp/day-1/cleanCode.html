Clean code
<h1>Refactoring</h1>
The main purpose of refactoring is to fight technical debt. It transforms a mess into clean code and simple design.

Nice! But what is clean code, anyway? Here are some of its features:

 Clean code is obvious for other programmers.
And I'm not talking about super sophisticated algorithms. Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers -you name it- all of that makes code sloppy and difficult to grasp.

 Clean code doesn't contain duplication.
Each time you have to make a change in a duplicate code, you have to remember to make the same change to every instance. This increases the cognitive load and slows down the progress.

 Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts.
Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is less maintenance. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.

 Clean code passes all tests.
You know your code is dirty when only 95% of your tests passed. You know you're screwed when you test coverage is 0%.

 Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain!

 When to refactor

Rule of Three
When you are doing something for the first time, just get it done.

When you are doing something similar for the second time, cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.

When you are doing something for the third time, start refactoring.


When adding a feature
Refactoring helps you understand other people's code. If you have to deal with someone else's dirty code, try to refactor it first. Clean code is much easier to grasp. You will improve it not only for yourself but also for those who use it after you.

Refactoring makes it easier to add new features. It's much easier to make changes in clean code.


When fixing a bug
Bugs in code behave just like those in real life: they live in the darkest, dirtiest places in the code. Clean your code and the errors will practically discover themselves.

Managers appreciate proactive refactoring as it eliminates the need for special refactoring tasks later. Happy bosses make happy programmers!


During a code review
The code review may be the last chance to tidy up the code before it becomes available to the public.

It's best to perform such reviews in a pair with an author. This way you could fix simple problems quickly and gauge the time for fixing the more difficult ones.

How to refactor
Refactoring should be done as a series of small changes, each of which makes the existing code slightly better while still leaving the program in working order.

Checklist of refactoring done right way
 The code should become cleaner.
If the code remains just as unclean after refactoring... well, I'm sorry, but you've just wasted an hour of your life. Try to figure out why this happened.

It frequently happens when you move away from refactoring with small changes and mix a whole bunch of refactorings into one big change. So it's very easy to lose your mind, especially if you have a time limit.

But it can also happen when working with extremely sloppy code. Whatever you improve, the code as a whole remains a disaster.

In this case, it's worthwhile to think about completely rewriting parts of the code. But before that, you should have written tests and set aside a good chunk of time. Otherwise, you'll end up with the kinds of results we talked about in the first paragraph.

 New functionality should not be created during refactoring.
Do not mix refactoring and direct development of new features. Try to separate these processes at least within the confines of individual commits.

 All existing tests must pass after refactoring.
There are two cases when tests can break down after refactoring:

You made an error during refactoring. This one is a no-brainer: go ahead and fix the error.

Your tests were too low-level. For example, you were testing private methods of classes.

In this case, the tests are to blame. You can either refactor the tests themselves or write an entirely new set of higher-level tests. A great way to avoid this kind of a situation is to write BDD-style tests.
