<h1>What is a hyperlink?</h1>
<p>
Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. 
Well, they've been a feature of the Web since the very beginning, but they are 
what makes the Web a Web â€” they allow us to link our documents to any other document 
(or other resource) we want to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, 
and we can make apps available at a simple web address (contrast this to native apps, 
which have to be installed and all that business.) Just about any web content can be 
converted to a link, so that when clicked (or otherwise activated) it will 
make the web browser go to another web address (URL).</p>
