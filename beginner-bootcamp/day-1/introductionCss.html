<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? 
This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), 
how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is 
used to actually include our CSS in our web page.

CSS is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, colour, 
size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and 
other decorative features. 

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience.
 Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, 
 for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
 How does CSS affect HTML?
 Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
 
 A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example 
 I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
 A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. 
 For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
