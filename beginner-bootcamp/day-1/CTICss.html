<h1>Color, Text and Images</h1>
<p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate 
    on is styling text â€” one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling 
    fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows and 
    other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
     lists and links.</p>
