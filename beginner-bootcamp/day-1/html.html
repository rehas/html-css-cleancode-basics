<p>To build websites, you should know about HTML â€” the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.

    Learning pathway
    Ideally, you should start your learning journey by learning HTML. Start by reading Introduction to HTML. You may then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:
    
    CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects.)
    
    
    It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic, however, it isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module, albeit in a lot more detail.

<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started. 
    We define elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have 
    heard, and where they fit into the language. We also show how an HTML element is 
    structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and explain other important
     basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you 
     interested! (LATER)

     What is HTML?
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:

My cat is very grumpy
If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph  (<p>) element:

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive, i.e. they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <title> tag could be written as <title>, <TITLE>, <Title>, <TiTlE>, etc., and it will work fine. Best practice, however, is to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.
